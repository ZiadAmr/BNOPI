# Bus route optimisation and planning interface

A simple interface designed to help with bus network planning. The interface provides both manual and automated planning. The primary purpose of this interface is to provide a simple framework for testing bus network planning algorithms (A simple evolutionary planning algorithm is provided with the code). 

## Documentation

For more detailed information about the project (such as dependencies and the user guide) please refer to docs.pdf.

## Getting started

To install and start the project
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. run `npm install'.
  3. run `npm run dev'.
  4. run `npm start'.

For running automated routing algorithms and c programs within the interface please refer to docs.pdf.

## Our contribution

This project was conducted by 4 fourth-year University students as our final-year project. We aimed to create an intuitive and elegant bus network planning interface that bridges the gap between algorithm implementation and real-world scenarios, enabling seamless integration. We are confident that this project has not only achieved its goal but also holds immense potential to make a significant contribution to the network planning research community.
